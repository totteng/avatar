Subject: Response to Notification of Penalty and Cost Coverage Regarding Earthworks for Z-Ring Road Project

Dear [CEO's Name],

Thank you for your letter dated [Date of the Original Letter]. We acknowledge the concerns raised regarding the issues with the earthworks performed by our subcontractor, Company C, on the Z-Ring Road project. We understand the seriousness of the situation and the implications it has on the projectâ€™s timeline and budget.

However, we would like to clarify the division of responsibility concerning the oversight and execution of the contracted work. As per the subcontractor agreement between Company B and Company C, it is explicitly stated that Company C is solely responsible for ensuring that all work performed adheres to the specifications provided by Company A and overseen by Company B. Company C's failure to meet these specifications, despite our oversight and guidance, was a direct result of their operational execution, which unfortunately went contrary to our agreed standards and practices.

Furthermore, Company B has consistently maintained rigorous quality checks and has provided adequate supervision. The lapses that occurred were beyond our control and were not detected during routine checks due to the nature of the errors, which were deeply technical and hidden post initial assessments.

Given these circumstances, we believe that the responsibility for covering the additional costs of QAR 500,000 and the imposed penalty of QAR 100,000 should fall on Company C. We are currently in discussions with Company C to address these financial responsibilities and to ensure that such errors are not repeated. We are committed to rectifying the situation promptly and have already initiated corrective measures in collaboration with Company C.

We request a meeting to discuss this matter further and to explore a mutually agreeable resolution. We believe that a collaborative approach will be beneficial in addressing the current challenges and to move forward constructively.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to resolving this matter in a way that maintains the integrity and timeline of the Z-Ring Road project.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
