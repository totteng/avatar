Subject: Notice of Penalty and Cost Coverage Due to Non-compliance with Earthworks Specifications

Dear [Project Manager's Name],

I am writing to express our serious concern regarding the recent findings on the Z-Ring Road project, specifically related to the earthworks performed by Company C under your supervision. It has come to our attention that the specifications provided were not adhered to, leading to significant errors that require the earthworks to be redone completely. This oversight has resulted in a projected delay of two months and an additional cost of QAR 500,000 to rectify the mistakes.

As stipulated in our contract and the expectations set forth by Generic Roadworks Company, it is imperative that all subcontracted work meets the standards and specifications required for successful project execution. The failure to oversee and ensure compliance by Company C not only affects the project timeline but also imposes considerable financial strain.

Therefore, in accordance with the contract terms and the responsibilities outlined therein, we are imposing a penalty of QAR 100,000. Additionally, Company B will be responsible for covering all additional costs incurred to correct the earthworks, totaling QAR 500,000. These measures are necessary to address the project setbacks and uphold the standards expected of all parties involved.

Please arrange for the penalty payment to be processed by [Due Date], and confirm your plan to manage the additional costs and rectify the current situation by [Response Due Date]. We trust that you will address this matter with the urgency and attention it demands to prevent further impact on the project.

We appreciate your immediate cooperation in resolving this issue and expect enhanced oversight on all subsequent activities under your management to ensure full compliance with all project specifications and timelines.

Should you require further discussion or clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me directly.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]  
CEO
